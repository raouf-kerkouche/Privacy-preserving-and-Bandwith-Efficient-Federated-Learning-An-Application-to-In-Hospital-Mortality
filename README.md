# Privacy-preserving-and-Bandwith-Efficient-Federated-Learning-An-Application-to-In-Hospital-Mortality

This repository contains all the codes and algorithms which are used in our submited paper: Privacy-preserving-and-Bandwith-Efficient-Federated-Learning-An-Application-to-In-Hospital-Mortality.

Our experiments were performed on a server running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS equipped with a Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4114 CPU @ 2.20GHz, 192GB RAM, and two NVIDIA Quadro P5000 GPU card of 16 Go each. We use Keras 2.2.0 with a TensorFlow backend 1.12.0 [1] and Numpy 1.14.3 [27] to implement our models and experiments. We use Python 3.6.5 and our code runs on a Docker container to simplify reproducibility.
